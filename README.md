# sql-challenge

For this challenge, I obtained 6 csv files that show employee, department, department manager, department employee, titles, and salary data. I used SQL to create the six tables and import the data into each of the table, identifying the primary and foreign keys for each. After importing all the files into their tables, I completed a series of queries to search through the database. The SQL commands to create the table are found in the table_schemata.sql file and my SQL queries are found in the queries.sql file. The desired queries are explained below. 

- List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
- List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
- List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
- List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
- List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
- List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
- List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
- List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
